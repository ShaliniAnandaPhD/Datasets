# Self-Organizing Neural Networks for Quantum-Driven Drug Discovery

This repository outlines a method for deploying **self-organizing neural networks (SONNs)** on a **quantum computing platform** to support **personalized drug discovery**. The approach combines quantum-native data representation (via Q-UEL), probabilistic inference (via Hyperbolic Dirac Nets), and advanced molecular modeling techniques.

## Overview

Drug development is a slow and resource-intensive process. To accelerate this pipeline, computational tools such as molecular modeling, rational drug design, combinatorial chemistry, and high-throughput screening have become essential. However, these technologies generate vast datasets that require intelligent analysis methods.

This project explores the use of **self-organizing neural networks**, particularly **Kohonen networks**, for:

- Modeling drug-receptor interactions
- Analyzing molecular shape and surface properties
- Designing new compounds based on structural similarity and activity
- Integrating probabilistic inference in drug selection pipelines

## Quantum Architecture and Q-UEL

The **Quantum Universal Exchange Language (Q-UEL)** is based on Dirac notation and quantum algebra. It provides a semantic framework for knowledge representation and probabilistic reasoning. Unlike traditional Semantic Web (SW) tools like RDF, OWL, or XML, Q-UEL is inherently suited to encode uncertainty, which is pervasive in biomedical and pharmaceutical data.

Q-UEL, combined with **Hyperbolic Dirac Nets (HDNs)**, supports:

- Probabilistic querying and inference
- Bidirectional reasoning via Bidirectional General Graphs (BGGs)
- Modeling of uncertainty in genomics, diagnostics, and treatment planning

This architecture addresses limitations of standard Bayesian Networks (BNs), which are constrained by directed acyclic graph structures and limited bidirectionality. HDNs generalize BNs by enabling more flexible, reversible inferences—critical for decision-making in medicine and drug development.

## Applications in Drug Discovery

Self-organizing networks provide topological mappings of complex data. In this method:

- A **one-to-one mapping** assigns a single molecule to its own Kohonen network.
- Alternatively, **many-to-one mapping** can represent multiple molecules within a shared network, useful for analyzing datasets or screening compound libraries.

To fully exploit these networks, novel representations of molecular structures are employed—ranging from atomic topologies to surface descriptors. These representations encode both geometric and physicochemical properties, facilitating feature extraction and clustering.

The framework supports:

- Rational drug design using unsupervised neural feature maps
- Probabilistic candidate prioritization
- Interoperability with structured review protocols (e.g. PRISMA)
- Semantic linking of molecular and clinical data

## Comparison to Related Work

Most Semantic Web tools lack native support for uncertainty modeling. While RDF, OWL, and XML-based systems offer useful schema-level interoperability, they do not handle probabilistic inference directly. Although Bayesian Networks in XML have been proposed, they inherit structural limitations.

Key differences:

| Feature | Semantic Web Tools | Q-UEL + HDN |
|--------|--------------------|--------------|
| Probabilistic Reasoning | External or limited | Intrinsic |
| Graph Structure | Directed Acyclic (BN) | Bidirectional General Graph |
| Clinical Utility | Limited | Designed for decision support |
| Genomic Uncertainty | Not supported | Modeled natively |

Q-UEL has also been evaluated for systematic reviews in medicine (e.g., PRISMA), though XML was occasionally favored for interoperability.
